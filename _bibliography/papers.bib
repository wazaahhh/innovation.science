	abstract = {Many natural and social systems are characterized by bursty dynamics, for which past events trigger future activity. These systems can be modelled by so-called self-excited Hawkes conditional Poisson processes. It is generally assumed that all events have similar triggering abilities. However, some systems exhibit heterogeneity and clusters with possibly different intra- and inter-triggering, which can be accounted for by generalization into the ” multivariate” self-excited Hawkes conditional Poisson processes. We develop the general formalism of the multivariate moment generating function for the cumulative number of first-generation and of all generation events triggered by a given mother event (the ” shock”) as a function of the current time t. This corresponds to studying the response function of the process. A variety of different systems have been analyzed. In particular, for systems in which triggering between events of different types proceeds through a one-dimension directed or symmetric chain of influence in type space, we report a novel hierarchy of intermediate asymptotic power law decays ∼ 1/t 1−(m+1)θ of the rate of triggered events as a function of the distance m of the events to the initial shock in the type space, where 0 {\textless} θ {\textless} 1 for the relevant long-memory processes characterizing many natural and social systems. The richness of the generated time dynamics comes from the cascades of intermediate events of possibly different kinds, unfolding via random changes of types genealogy.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of technological, economic and social phenomena is controlled by how humans organize their daily tasks in response to both endogenous and exogenous stimulations. Queueing theory is believed to provide a generic answer to account for the often observed power-law distributions of waiting times before a task is fulfilled. However, the general validity of the power law and the nature of other regimes remain unsettled. Using anonymized data collected by Google at the World Wide Web level, we identify the existence of several additional regimes characterizing the time required for a population of Internet users to execute a given task after receiving a message. Depending on the under- or over-utilization of time by the population of users and the strength of their response to perturbations, the pure power law is found to be coextensive with an exponential regime (tasks are performed without too much delay) and with a crossover to an asymptotic plateau (some tasks are never performed).},

	abstract = {With the development of the Internet, new kinds of massive epidemics, distributed attacks, virtual conflicts and criminality have emerged. We present a study of some striking statistical properties of cyber-risks that quantify the distribution and time evolution of information risks on the Internet, to understand their mechanisms, and create opportunities to mitigate, control, predict and insure them at a global scale. First, we report an exceptionnaly stable power-law tail distribution of personal identity losses per event, Pr(ID loss ≥ V) ∼ 1/Vb, with b = 0.7 ± 0.1. This result is robust against a surprising strong non-stationary growth of ID losses culminating in July 2006 followed by a more stationary phase. Moreover, this distribution is identical for different types and sizes of targeted organizations. Since b {\textless} 1, the cumulative number of all losses over all events up to time t increases faster-than-linear with time according to t1/b, suggesting that privacy, characterized by personal identities, is necessarily becoming more and more insecure. We also show the existence of a size effect, such that the largest possible ID losses per event grow faster-than-linearly as ∼S1.3 with the organization size S. The small value b 0.7 of the power law distribution of ID losses is explained by the interplay between Zipf's law and the size effect. We also infer that compromised entities exhibit basically the same probability to incur a small or large loss.},

	abstract = {Organizations exist because they provide additional production gains, in comparison to horizontal ways of allocating resources, such as markets (Coase, 1937), and the open source movement is deemed to be a new kind of peer-production organization somehow in between hierarchically organized firms and markets (Benkler, 2002). However, to strive as a new kind of organization, open source must provide production gains, which in turn should be measurable. The open source movement is particularly interesting to study for this reason. Here, we confront and discuss two contrasting views, which were reported in the literature recently. On the one hand, Sornette et al. (2014) uncovered a superlinear production mechanism, which quantifies Aristotle adage: “the whole is more than the sum of its parts”. On the other hand, Scholtes et al. (2016) found opposite results, and referred to Maximilien Ringelmann, a French agricultural engineer (1861–1931), who discovered the tendency for individual members of a group to become increasingly less productive as the size of their group increases (Ringelmann, 1913). Since Ringelmann, the topic of collective intelligence has interested numbers of researchers in social sciences and social psychology (Woolley et al., 2010), as well as practitioners in management aiming at improving the performance of their team (Woolley et al., 2015). In most research and practice case studies, the Ringelmann effect has been found to hold, while, in contrast, the superlinear effect found by Sornette et al. is novel and may challenge common wisdom (Sornette et al., 2014). Here, we compare these two theories, weigh their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss how they have been tested with empirical data. We find that they may not contradict each other as much as was claimed by Scholtes et al. (2016).},

	abstract = {Bug bounty programs offer a modern way for organizations to crowdsource their software security, and for security researchers to be fairly rewarded for the vulnerabilities they find. However, little is known on the incentives set by bug bounty programs – how they drive engagement and new bug discoveries. This article provides an empirical investigation of the strategic interactions among the managers and participants of bug bounty programs, as well as the intermediation by bug bounty platforms. We find that for a given bug bounty program, each security researcher can only expect to discover a bounded number of bugs. This result offers a validation step to a theory brought forth early on by Brady et al. This theory proposes that each security researcher inspecting a piece of software offers a unique environment of skills and mindset, which is amenable to the discovery of bugs that others may not be able to uncover. Bug bounty programs indeed benefit from the engagement of large crowds of researchers. Conversely, security researchers benefit greatly from searching for bugs in multiple bug bounty programs. However, we find that following a strong front-loading effect, newly launched programs attract researchers at the expense of older programs: the probability of finding bugs decays as ∼1/t0.4 after the launch of a program, even though bugs found later yield on average higher rewards. Our results lead us to formulate three recommendations for organizing bug bounty programs and platforms: (i) organize enrollment, mobility, and renewal of security researchers across bounty programs, (ii) highlight and organize programs for front-loading, and (iii) organize fluid market transactions to reduce uncertainty and thus reduce incentives for security researchers to sell on the black market.},

	abstract = {Clinical research in autism has recently witnessed promising digital phenotyping results, mainly focused on single feature extraction, such as gaze, head turn on name-calling or visual tracking of the moving object. The main drawback of these studies is the focus on relatively isolated behaviors elicited by largely controlled prompts. We recognize that while the diagnosis process understands the indexing of the specific behaviors, ASD also comes with broad impairments that often transcend single behavioral acts. For instance, the atypical nonverbal behaviors manifest through global patterns of atypical postures and movements, fewer gestures used and often decoupled from visual contact, facial affect, speech. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a deep neural network trained on the non-verbal aspects of social interaction can effectively differentiate between children with ASD and their typically developing peers. Our model achieves an accuracy of 80.9\% (F1 score: 0.818; precision: 0.784; recall: 0.854) with the prediction probability positively correlated to the overall level of symptoms of autism in social affect and repetitive and restricted behaviors domain. Provided the non-invasive and affordable nature of computer vision, our approach carries reasonable promises that a reliable machine-learning-based ASD screening may become a reality not too far in the future.},

The quality of knowledge artifacts (e.g. article, source code file) is deeply tied to their individual expertise, and to their ability to collaborate well. Conversely, the expertise of contributors is a function of artifacts contributed to. Building upon a large stream of literature on the measurement of article quality and contributor expertise, we propose a recursive algorithm to measure how editor expertise influences the quality of articles, and how contributions to articles influence editor expertise. This bi-partite network random walker metric reveals the specific structure of cooperation and how the quality of articles is achieved through coordination. We show that while the wisdom of crowds is well pulled in some categories, more editors per article can also create disvalue.},

	abstract = {Cyber risk encompasses a broad spectrum of risks to digital systems, such as data breaches or full-fledged cyber attacks on the electric grid. Efforts to systematically advance the science of cyber risk must draw on not only computer science but also fields such as behavioral science, economics, law, management science, and political science. Yet, many scholars believe that they have sufficient understanding of other fields to comprehensively address the inherently cross-disciplinary nature of cyber risk. For example, a statistician might apply Bayesian modeling to predict future cyber events, even though it is not entirely clear what bearing historical cyber events have on future ones. Computer scientists might write on data protection laws, yet with little knowledge of legal jurisdiction issues. Such questions of disciplinary ownership, the inability to coordinate across disciplines, and the undefined scope of the problem domain have thus plagued inherently cross-disciplinary cyber risk research. Drawing on global expertise and challenges from industry, academia, nonprofit organizations, and governments, we adapted the classical risk-management process to identify core research questions for cyber risk, gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed for advances in security, and opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaboration for each area. Although we mention specific disciplines reflective of our backgrounds, these are not the only ones that should be conducting cyber risk research.

	abstract = {Study Objectives:Actigraphy, the tool of choice for assessment of sleep phase disorders, is insensitive to movement-free waking. This study aimed to determine whether the detection of waking could be performed by recording instrumental responses to haptic stimuli delivered by a low-cost device.Methods:Twenty adults underwent 2 nights of laboratory polysomnography (PSG) while wearing a fingerless glove under which a stimulating actigraph (“Wakemeter”) was apposed to the palm. The Wakemeter, controlled by a tablet computer, delivered gentle, haptic stimuli every 10 minutes during the sleep period. If a stimulus was detected, the participant squeezed the Wakemeter. Stimulus times, response times and movements were streamed to the tablet. Concurrent PSG data were scored blind to stimuli and responses. Self-reported sleep quality ratings were collected each morning.Results:The Wakemeter was acceptable to 19 of 20 participants, and effects on self-reported and objective sleep were small. The probability of a response to the stimulus during a wake epoch was high regardless of movement. In contrast, actigraphy magnitude distributions were indistinguishable across epochs scored wake without movement versus sleep, confirming a known limitation of actigraphy. A simple method for calculating sleep efficiency from responses to the stimuli yielded estimates that were highly correlated with PSG-derived estimates (rho = .69, P {\textless} .001).Conclusions:Behavioral responses to haptic stimuli detected epochs of movement-free wake during the sleep period and may augment actigraphy in the low-burden estimation of sleep efficiency. Acceptability of the method over longer recording periods remains to be established.Citation:Miller KE, Bäbler L, Maillart T, Faerman A, Woodward SH.

	abstract = {Personal data breaches from organisations, enabling mass identity fraud, constitute an extreme risk. This risk worsens daily as an ever-growing amount of personal data are stored by organisations and on-line, and the attack surface surrounding this data becomes larger and harder to secure. Further, breached information is distributed and accumulates in the hands of cyber criminals, thus driving a cumulative erosion of privacy. Statistical modeling of breach data from 2000 through 2015 provides insights into this risk: A current maximum breach size of about 200 million is detected, and is expected to grow by fifty percent over the next five years. The breach sizes are found to be well modeled by an extremely heavy tailed truncated Pareto distribution, with tail exponent parameter decreasing linearly from 0.57 in 2007 to 0.37 in 2015. With this current model, given a breach contains above fifty thousand items, there is a ten percent probability of exceeding ten million. A size effect is unearthed where both the frequency and severity of breaches scale with organisation size like s 0.6. Projections indicate that the total amount of breached information is expected to double from two to four billion items within the next five years, eclipsing the population of users of the Internet. This massive and uncontrolled dissemination of personal identities raises fundamental concerns about privacy.},

	abstract = {From biotechnology to cyber-risks, most extreme technological risks cannot be reliably estimated from historical statistics. Therefore, engineers resort to predictive methods, such as fault/event trees in the framework of probabilistic safety assessment (PSA), which consists in developing models to identify triggering events, potential accident scenarios, and estimate their severity and frequency. However, even the best safety analysis struggles to account for evolving risks resulting from inter-connected networks and cascade effects. Taking nuclear risks as an example, the predicted plant-specific distribution of losses is found to be significantly underestimated when compared with available empirical records. Using a novel database of 99 events with losses larger than \$50000 constructed by Sovacool, we document a robust power law distribution with tail exponent μ≈0.7. A simple cascade model suggests that the classification of the different possible safety regimes is intrinsically unstable in the presence of cascades. Additional continuous development and validation, making the best use of the experienced realized incidents, near misses and accidents, is urgently needed to address the existing known limitations of PSA when aiming at the estimation of total risks.},

	abstract = {Tracking changes in feature distributions is very important in the domain of network anomaly detection. Unfortunately, these distributions consist of thousands or even millions of data points. This makes tracking, storing and visualizing changes over time a difficult task. A standard technique for capturing and describing distributions in a compact form is the Shannon entropy analysis. Its use for detecting network anomalies has been studied in-depth and several anomaly detection approaches have applied it with considerable success. However, reducing the information about a distribution to a single number deletes important information such as the nature of the change or it might lead to overlooking a large amount of anomalies entirely. In this paper, we show that a generalized form of entropy is better suited to capture changes in traffic features, by exploring different moments. We introduce the Traffic Entropy Spectrum (TES) to analyze changes in traffic feature distributions and demonstrate its ability to characterize the structure of anomalies using traffic traces from a large ISP.},
